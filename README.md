 // I used my api controllers and service folder to get my madlib Revering it and my odd or even to work in swagger

 // You can add multiple dates with description.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment (Brandon Estrada) - Your project si functional, I am able to get and endpoint to your api and have the messages return back. There is a slight issue, your odd or even doesn't have data validation to check for valid number input but your reverseit numbers only does. I recommend you follow that same logic for your odd or even.
